SDK for python based apps running within oasys.


## Quickstart

To create a python app for the oasys platform:
 
 1. [fork this repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/), or create a new repository and copy this repo's source code into it.
  
 2. Change the 'myapp' folder to any valid name you wish.
 
 3. Update the `name` field in `setup.py` to the name chosen in the previous step, and apply a version number. Any version numbers are valid within oasys, but we strongly recommend either [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) convention, or using the git hash of the currently checked out version (see `git rev-parse HEAD`)
 
 4.
