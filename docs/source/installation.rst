Installation
============

To use the Octue SDK from within your Octue Python application, simply add:

.. code-block::

    octue==x.y.z

to your ``requirements.txt`` file, where x.y.z. is your preferred (we recommend the latest stable) version of the SDK.

If you've used the 'octue-app-python' application as your base template, you should already have the SDK installed
(`see how it's done in the example app <https://github.com/octue/octue-app-python>`)
