Version History
===============
See our `releases on GitHub. <https://github.com/octue/octue-sdk-python/releases>`_ Note that `octue` is still in beta,
so both breaking changes and features are denoted by an increase in the minor version number. This means the major
version number can remain at 0, denoting a beta package. Breaking changes are clearly marked in pull requests and
release notes.
